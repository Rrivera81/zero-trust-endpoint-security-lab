# 🔐 Zero Trust Endpoint Security Lab

A practical cybersecurity lab designed to simulate a Zero Trust enterprise environment. This lab demonstrates key Zero Trust security concepts such as application allowlisting, policy-driven access control, and least privilege enforcement using Windows Server and Windows 10 endpoints.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project recreates a realistic corporate environment in which endpoint security is enforced through policy, not trust. Using Active Directory, Group Policy Objects (GPO), and built-in Windows tools, I applied a deny-by-default security model across multiple users and machines to replicate modern Zero Trust architecture in a lab setting.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Apply **Zero Trust principles** to endpoint security
- Create **application control policies** using GPO and Software Restriction Policies (SRP)
- Enforce **least privilege access** across standard and privileged users
- Demonstrate how **policy-driven restrictions** block unauthorized behavior
- Simulate **basic incident detection and response scenarios**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| VirtualBox | Virtual environment setup |
| Windows Server 2019 | Domain controller, Group Policy, DNS |
| Windows 10 | Endpoint testing for different user types |
| Active Directory | Centralized identity and access management |
| Group Policy (GPO) | Enforce security configurations and app control |
| Windows Firewall | Network-level access enforcement |
| PowerShell / CMD | Scripting, diagnostics, configuration |

## 🧩 Features & Highlights

- 🛑 **Application Allowlisting:** Only approved applications can run
- 👤 **User Segmentation:** Different access levels for Admin, IT, and HR users
- 🔒 **Policy-Driven Control:** All access managed centrally through GPO
- 🚫 **Blocked Executables:** SRP and AppLocker policies in place (depending on version)
- 🧪 **Incident Simulation:** Demonstrates a blocked user action + logs
- 📸 **Screenshots & Documentation** of full configuration
