# 🚨 Incident Simulation: Unauthorized Application Execution

This document outlines a simulation of an endpoint security incident within the Zero Trust lab environment. The scenario tests how the system responds to an unauthorized application executed by a non-privileged user.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Simulate a user attempting to run an **unauthorized executable file** in violation of established application control policies. Monitor system response, enforcement behavior, and log generation.

---

## 🧪 Scenario Details

- **User Role:** HR Staff (Standard User)
- **Machine:** HR-PC01 (Windows 10, joined to lab.local domain)
- **Action Simulated:** Attempt to run an `.exe` file from the Downloads folder
- **Security Policy Enforced:** Software Restriction Policies (SRP) or AppLocker deny rules
- **Expected Behavior:** Application is blocked and an event is logged

---

## 🔐 Pre-Configured Policy

- GPO applied to the `HR` OU
- Software Restriction Policy:
  - Default Security Level: **Disallowed**
  - Allow Rules:
    - `C:\Program Files\*`
    - `C:\Windows\*`
- Disallowed Paths:
  - `C:\Users\*\Downloads\*`
  - Removable media (e.g., D:\*, E:\*)

---

## 🧫 Steps Performed

1. Logged in as `SarahB@lab.local` (HR Staff)
2. Downloaded a test `.exe` (e.g., Notepad++ installer) to the Downloads folder
3. Double-clicked the file to attempt execution

---

## ❌ System Behavior

- Execution was **blocked immediately**
- Pop-up message:  
  > *“This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator.”*
- Application did **not launch**

---

## 📊 Event Viewer Logs

Navigated to:  
**Event Viewer > Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > AppLocker > EXE and DLL**

**Logged Event Example:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Event ID | 8004 |
| Source | AppLocker |
| User | LAB\SarahB |
| File Path | `C:\Users\SarahB\Downloads\notepad++.exe` |
| Outcome | Denied by Rule |

Alternatively, for SRP:  
**Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application**  
Look for **Event ID 865** (Software Restriction Policy violation)

---

## 🧩 Security Validation

✔️ Unauthorized executable blocked  
✔️ Event generated and viewable  
✔️ No privilege escalation or security bypass possible  
✔️ Demonstrates Zero Trust enforcement in action

## 📝 Summary

This simulation validates the lab's ability to **detect and prevent** unapproved user behavior on endpoints. It replicates a real-world security control scenario where users are restricted by policy, not just intent.

The Zero Trust model held up by:
- Blocking non-whitelisted software
- Providing clear system feedback
- Logging violations for auditing and incident response
