# 🔐 Zero Trust Concepts in This Lab

This document explains the core Zero Trust security principles applied in the lab and how they were implemented using practical tools like Group Policy, Active Directory, and endpoint security controls.

## 💡 What is Zero Trust?

**Zero Trust** is a cybersecurity model based on the idea of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that threats can exist both **outside and inside** the network, so no user, device, or application is automatically trusted — even if they are inside the firewall.

Instead of relying on perimeter-based defenses, Zero Trust emphasizes:
- Strong identity verification
- Least privilege access
- Continuous monitoring
- Strict enforcement of access policies

## 🛠️ How This Lab Applies Zero Trust

| Zero Trust Principle | Lab Implementation |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Deny by Default** | Used Software Restriction Policies to block all applications except explicitly allowed ones |
| **Least Privilege** | Created non-admin users with limited access and rights per department |
| **Role-Based Access Control** | Segmented users using Active Directory Organizational Units and Security Groups |
| **Strong Access Policies** | Applied GPOs to block access to command line, Control Panel, downloads, removable drives |
| **Application Control** | Enforced via SRP/AppLocker to allow only trusted apps from approved directories |
| **User Verification** | Domain login enforced, passwords set with complexity rules |
| **Audit & Monitoring** | Policy violations logged in Event Viewer for forensic review |

## 🧱 Example Use Case Simulated

- A user in the HR department attempts to launch a file downloaded from the internet.
- Because the policy is **deny-by-default**, and Downloads is not an allowed path:
  - The executable is **blocked**
  - The attempt is **logged**
  - The user is **prevented from bypassing** the restriction (no PowerShell/CMD)

This mirrors real-world scenarios where Zero Trust prevents insider threat behavior or compromised endpoints from running unauthorized software.

## 🔄 Why This Model Matters

Traditional security models assume anything inside the network can be trusted. But attackers often gain access through:
- Phishing a user’s credentials
- Exploiting an unpatched system
- Misusing access rights

With Zero Trust, even a valid login or internal IP address does not guarantee access. This model **slows attackers down**, increases detection, and reduces the blast radius of a breach.

## ✅ Key Benefits of the Lab Approach

- No need for expensive third-party tools — enforced using **built-in Windows features**
- Teaches fundamentals of real-world endpoint defense
- Aligns with frameworks like **NIST 800-207**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and **CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model**
- Demonstrates **hands-on experience**, not just theory

## 🧠 Summary

Zero Trust isn’t a single product — it’s a mindset.

This lab puts that mindset into action using the tools available in most enterprise networks:
- Active Directory
- GPO
- Windows Defender
- Standard users and groups

By focusing on **identity**, **access control**, and **policy enforcement**, the lab simulates how Zero Trust protects organizations from both internal and external threats.
