# 🛡️ Project Overview: Zero Trust Endpoint Security Lab

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this lab is to simulate a modern enterprise security environment built on **Zero Trust principles**, focusing on application allowlisting and policy-driven access control. It demonstrates how to enforce least privilege, restrict unauthorized applications, and build a defensive system assuming breach by default.

## 🧠 What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a security model based on the principle of “**never trust, always verify**.” Instead of assuming everything inside a corporate network is safe, this model continuously validates identity, device posture, and access permissions.

This lab applies Zero Trust concepts to endpoints by:
- Enforcing application allowlisting using GPO
- Limiting user privileges through group-based access control
- Restricting access by user roles (IT, HR, Admin, etc.)
- Blocking unapproved applications and monitoring behavior

## 🛠️ Lab Environment

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Windows Server 2019** | Domain Controller (DC), DNS, Group Policy |
| **Windows 10 Clients** | Endpoint testing for policy enforcement |
| **Active Directory** | Centralized user and device management |
| **Group Policy Objects (GPO)** | Define and enforce restrictions |
| **VirtualBox** | Host platform for running the lab |
| **PowerShell & CMD** | Used for scripting, validation, and troubleshooting |

## 🧩 Key Features Implemented

- ✅ **Domain Setup:** lab.local domain configured with proper DNS and user accounts
- 👤 **User Segmentation:** HR, IT, Admin, and Sales users created and grouped
- 🔒 **Application Control:** Policies created to block unauthorized executables
- 🔐 **Access Control:** GPO rules limit access to control panel, registry, and more
- 🚫 **Default-Deny Posture:** Only whitelisted applications allowed to run
- 🧪 **Incident Simulation:** Created a test case where a restricted app is blocked
