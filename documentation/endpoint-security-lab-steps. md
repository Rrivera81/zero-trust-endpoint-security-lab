# 🧪 Endpoint Security Lab Steps

This file documents the complete setup process for the Zero Trust Endpoint Security Lab, including domain setup, user creation, application control policies, and security testing.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Lab Environment Setup

- Installed **VirtualBox** as the virtualization platform
- Created the following virtual machines:
  - `Server2019-DC` (Windows Server 2019)
  - `Win10-IT`
  - `Win10-HR`
  - `Win10-Finance`
- Configured a **host-only network adapter** for internal communication between VMs

---

## 🖥️ 2. Domain Controller Configuration

- Promoted `Server2019-DC` to a Domain Controller using `lab.local` domain
- Installed and configured:
  - Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
  - DNS role
- Verified domain with:
  - `ping lab.local`
  - `nslookup` and `ipconfig /all` on client machines

---

## 👤 3. Active Directory Structure

- Created OU structure:
  - `Company`
    - `IT`, `HR`, `Finance`, `Sales`
  - `Workstations`
    - `IT-Computers`, `HR-Computers`, etc.
  - `Security Groups`
    - `IT-Admins`, `HR-Staff`, `VPN-Users`, etc.
- Created users:
  - Example: `Emily.IT`, `Sarah.HR`, `Evan.Finance`
- Assigned users to security groups and OUs

---

## 🧷 4. Client Domain Join

- Joined each Windows 10 client to `lab.local` domain
  - Used domain admin credentials to complete the join
- Verified domain status with:
  - `whoami`
  - `systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"Domain"`

---

## 🔐 5. GPO Configuration (Application Control)

- Created custom GPOs and linked them to OUs
  - Restricted access to Control Panel, Run, Registry
  - Applied **Software Restriction Policies (SRP)** for app control
    - Deny all by default
    - Allow specific paths (e.g., `C:\Program Files`)
  - Optionally implemented **AppLocker** rules (if using Enterprise)

---

## 🚫 6. Zero Trust Enforcement

- Logged into endpoint as non-admin users (HR, IT, etc.)
- Attempted to run unauthorized apps (e.g., EXEs from Downloads folder)
- Verified enforcement of:
  - Deny-by-default posture
  - Least privilege
  - Blocked access to restricted tools or apps

---

## 🧪 7. Incident Simulation (Overview)

- Simulated a restricted user attempting to run:
  - Unsigned `.exe`
  - Powershell script outside of whitelisted paths
- Observed:
  - Blocked execution message
  - Event log entries in **Windows Event Viewer**

---

## 🪛 8. Troubleshooting Steps Taken

- Resolved VM networking issues (host-only adapter misconfig)
- Corrected domain join errors by adjusting DNS settings
- Fixed login issues by resetting passwords and adjusting GPO logon rights

---

## 📸 9. Documentation and Evidence

- Captured screenshots of:
  - Domain join process
  - GPO configuration
  - Blocked applications
  - User access testing
- Organized all files in GitHub repository under:
  - `/configs/`
  - `/documentation/`
  - `/screenshots/`
